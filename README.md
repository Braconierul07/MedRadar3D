# MedRADAR3D

MedRADAR3D is an assistan-system for general practitioners, which allows them to recognize/diagnose a skin anomaly and seek help (possibly remotely) from a specialist physician

## How does it work?

The device's axis of rotation (marked by a laser) is placed over the patient's affected skin area. This is made easier by the lockable wheel mounted on the bottom of its frame. After this the physician, making use of the interface, adjusts the Z axis until the abnormality itself finds itself in the middle of the image frame. Having done that, he/she can start the preprogrammed sequence for scanning the skin region.
